## Project Overview
This project aims to address real-world problems using machine learning models. We selected a dataset from Kaggle that involves image or text data for computer vision or natural language processing tasks. Our work encompasses three main experiments: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and implementing State-of-the-Art Models.

## Getting Started
To run our project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- PIL
- matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

You can install these dependencies via pip:
```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy Pillow matplotlib
```

### Dataset
Our project uses the "Face Mask Detection" dataset from Kaggle. To download and set up the dataset:
1. Visit [Kaggle's Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection).
2. Download the dataset and extract it to a folder named `dataset` in the project directory.

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - For the supervised model: `python supervised_model.py`
   - For the unsupervised model: `python unsupervised_model.py`
   - For the state-of-the-art model: `python sota_model.py`

### Results
The output and results will be stored in a subfolder named `results` within the project directory.

## Additional Information
- Detailed instructions for each script and model can be found within the script files as comments.
- For any issues or questions, please reach out to any of the team members.
