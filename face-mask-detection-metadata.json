With this dataset, it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly.\nThis dataset contains **853** images belonging to the **3** classes, as well as their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format.\nThe classes are:\n- With mask;\n- Without mask;\n- Mask worn incorrectly.\n\n\n\n# How to Use this Data\n\u0026gt; ### Suggested Notebooks\n- [Pytorch FasterRCNN](https://www.kaggle.com/daniel601/pytorch-fasterrcnn) by [Daniel](https://www.kaggle.com/daniel601)\n\u0026gt; ### More Datasets\nFor more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets).\n\n# How to Cite this Dataset\nIf you use this dataset, please credit the authors\n\n### BibTeX\n\u0026gt; @misc{make ml,\n                title={Mask Dataset},\n                url={https://makeml.app/datasets/mask},\n                journal={Make ML}\n                }\n\n\n### License\n\u0026gt; Public Domain\n\n### Splash Banner\n\u0026gt; Photo by engin akyurt on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/AS-ksEGPa2c)\n\n\n"}
